## Pull Request

After you've created a branch on your fork with your changes, it's time to [make a pull request][pr-link]!

:) Time to submit a pull request after that.

### Pull Request Pro Tips

* [Fork][fork-link] the repository and [clone][clone-link] it locally.
Connect your local repository to the original `upstream` repository by adding it as a [remote][remote-link].
Pull in changes from `upstream` often so that you stay up to date and so when you submit your pull request,
merge conflicts will be less likely. See more detailed instructions [here][syncing-link].
* Create a [branch][branch-link].
* Please make sure you squash all commits together before opening a pull request. If your pull request requires changes upon review, please be sure to squash all additional commits as well. [This wiki page][squash-link] outlines the squash process.
